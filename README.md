# hello-world
My name is Kenneth Curtis. 

I am currently exploring the world of Web Development while working as a full time Commercial Producer.
My plan is to transition away from producing commercials and become a full time web developer. I have found that I have a passion for
how computers work, and the inner workings of websites and software. Programming has been challenging and fun for me so far, I can't 
wait to see what is in store for me.
